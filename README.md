# Tabletop-Tools
A collection of tools for Tabletop RPGs. Mostly created so I can practice ReactJS.

As of 9/27/2018, a rudimentary Monster HP Tracker (for encounters) is up and running. It was designed with tablets in mind (though since this was more of a
  practice project, I haven't spent a lot of time on UX and layout.)

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the prerequisites installed. Clone this repository and open
a command line in the project's top-level directory. Then, simply run:

```
yarn install
```

followed by:

```
yarn start
```

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and the Yarn package manager installed to run this application. You may be able to use NPM instead of Yarn, but I am personally using Yarn.

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Library used
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - JavaScript Library used
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - Package Management
